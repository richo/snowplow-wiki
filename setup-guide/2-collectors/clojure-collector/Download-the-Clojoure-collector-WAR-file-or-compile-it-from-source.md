You can download the WAR file directly from Github [here][github-download] or from S3 [here][s3-download].

Alternatively, you can build it from the source files. To do so, you will need [Leiningen][leiningen] installed. 

To do so, download the SnowPlow repo:

	$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow.git

Navigate into the clojure collector folder:

	$ cd 2-collectors/clojure-collector

Download the required dependencies:

	$ lein deps

And then build the `war` file:

	$ lein ring uberwar

The `war` file will be saved in the `target` subdirectory.

We now need to add a couple of files to the `war`, that were not included as part of the `lein ring uberwar` command above. These files customize the format of the log files generated so that they include all the relevant data points (in particular, the `user_id`), and ensure that the log files have the same format as those generated by the [Cloudfront collector](setting up the cloudfront collector). To add both files, first navigate into the `war-resources` directory:

	$ cd war-resources

Then execute the following two commands:

	$ jar uf ../target/clojure-collector-0.1.0-standalone.war .ebextensions/server.xml 
	$ jar uf ../target/clojure-collector-0.1.0-standalone.war .ebextensions/server-update.config
	$ jar uf ../target/clojure-collector-0.1.0-standalone.war .ebextensions/cf-access-log-valve-0.0.1.jar

The `war` file is now ready to be deployed to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk.

Next: [[create a new application in Elastic Beanstalk and upload the WAR file into it]]
